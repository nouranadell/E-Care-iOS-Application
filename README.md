# E-Care-iOS-Application

## Project Description

E-care is a system that continuously monitors elderly peopleâ€™s health and wellbeing through smartwatches. The system mainly focuses on Fall Detection and Indoor Localization. Moreover,  the application also aims to  facilitate the communication between the elderly and their caregivers by having a communication channel and providing real-time health data and reports. 

E-Care is my Graduation project along with 4 other members. All of us are Computer Engineering Undergrads in The American University in Cairo (AUC). 
One of main roles was developing the iOS application for the system.
